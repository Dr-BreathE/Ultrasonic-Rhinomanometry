# The Ultrasonic Nasal Air-Flow Meter

This is an innovative technology where we employ ultrasonic techniques to transmit nasal airflow signals. It operates without the need for WIFI or BLUETOOTH; merely granting microphone permissions on your phone allows for data transmission through ultrasonics.

# What is the product feature?

1. **Ultrasonic Transmission Technology**:
   - Utilizes ultrasonic waves for data transmission, leveraging the unique properties of sound waves to avoid wireless interference and enhance the stability of data transfer.

2. **No WIFI or Bluetooth Setup Required**:
   - Eliminates the need for complicated wireless setup processes, using ultrasonic waves to communicate directly with the smartphone's microphone, simplifying the user experience.

3. **Autonomous Calibration in the APP**:
   - Features an in-built autonomous calibration function within the app to ensure accurate and consistent measurements across different distances and phone models.

4. **Quantitative Measurements**:
   - Offers comprehensive and quantitative data measurements that are unaffected by the model of the phone or the distance of use, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data.

5. **Side-specific Nasal Flow Measurements**:
   - Capable of separately measuring the inhalation flow rate and volume for the left and right sides of the nose, providing a detailed analysis of nasal health.

6. **Digital Data Recording**:
   - Digitally records measurement results, facilitating long-term tracking and analysis of trends and improvements in nasal flow.
   

# How to use the product?

1. **Powering the Nasal Flow Device**:
   - Turn on the nasal flow device by using a battery or a Type-C charging cable.

2. **Launching the Nasal Flow App**:
   - Open the nasal flow app on your smartphone.

3. **Calibration**:
   - Upon opening the app, start the calibration process. This takes approximately 10 seconds. Wait until the screen indicates that the calibration is complete.

4. **Preparing the Device for Use & attaching the Nasal Flow Tube**:
   - Before use, ensure that the nasal flow tube is properly attached to the device.
   
   - Insert the other end of the nasal flow tube into the nostril of the person being measured.

6. **Starting the Measurement**:
   - Press the 'Start' button to begin measuring the inhalation volume.

7. **Viewing Results**:
   - After the measurement, you can view the nasal flow rate, flow volume for the left and right nostrils, and the total volume flow in the app.
